This is a implemeentation of the dynamic weight aggregation method, please refer to the papers below:

[1] Y. Jin, T. Okabe and B. Sendhoff. Adapting weighted aggregation for multiobjective evolution strategies. First International Conference on Evolutionary Multi-criteria Optimization, LNCS 1993, pp.96-110, Springer, 2001

[3] Y. Jin. Effectiveness of weighted sum of the objectives for evolutionary multi-objective optimization: Methods, analysis and applications. Unpublished manuscript. 2002 

I found my implementation was better than the experimental results presented in [1].
